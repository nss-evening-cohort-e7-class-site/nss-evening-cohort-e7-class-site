During this time, I had the privilege of staying home with my children while working part time. This afforded me the opportunity to do some soul searching in regards to finding a meaningful and fulfilling career. I had always been interested in learning about new technologies and had found myself studying software development through sites like code academy and team treehouse. I had some close friends who worked in development that persuaded me to look into Nashville Software School. NSS has turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made.
