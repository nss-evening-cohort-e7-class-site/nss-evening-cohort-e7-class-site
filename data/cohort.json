I began my journey by teaching myself, but realized that I could get much more out of the experience in a classroom setting. After a little research, I found my way to Nashville Software School. Nashville Software School has taught me how to think like a developer and how to write clean, readable code. It has also taught me to believe in myself in this field. I once had a horrible case of imposter syndrome, but thanks to the awesome community this school provides, I’ve been able to apply myself and build some pretty awesome projects! I am so excited to continue my journey as a web developer and can’t wait to teach other little girls that they too can code pretty awesome projects!</p>",

I began reading everything I could find related to technology, listening to podcasts, and watching videos on sites like Lynda.com and Team Treehouse.
